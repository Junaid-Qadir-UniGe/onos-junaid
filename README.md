Introduction: What is ONOS?

**ONOS** stands for **O**pen** N**etwork** O**perating** S**ystem. ONOS provides the control plane for a software-defined network (SDN), managing network components, such as switches and links, and running software programs or modules to provide *communication services* to end hosts and neighboring networks.

* If you are familiar with  *server operating systems* , you will find that ONOS provides some analogous types of functionality, including APIs and abstractions, resource allocation, and permissions, as well as user-facing software such as a [CLI](https://wiki.onosproject.org/display/ONOS/The+ONOS+CLI), a [GUI](https://wiki.onosproject.org/display/ONOS/The+ONOS+Web+GUI), and system applications.
* If you are familiar with traditional "inside the box"  *switch operating systems* , you will find that ONOS manages your *entire* network rather than a single device, which can dramatically simplify management, configuration, and deployment of new software, hardware and services.
* If you are familiar with  *SDN controllers* , you should feel right at home because the ONOS platform and applications act as an extensible, modular, distributed SDN controller.
